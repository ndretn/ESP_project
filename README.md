# ESP (Embedded Systems Programming) Final Project #

This repository contains the code of the final project of the Embedded Systems Programming course at the master degree in Computer Engineering of the University of Padua, Italy, academic year 2016-2017.

The aim of the project was the design and the implementation of an android camera app that captures a scene at different exposures, then blends the captured images into a single HDR picture,
and finally applies tone mapping to obtain an LDR image for conventional displays.
